# Text Generation from Debate Transcript

This model generates vaguely coherent text based on a transcript from the presidential debate between K. Harris and D. Trump that took place on September 11, 2024. 
The transcript is processed using a trigram model to create sentences. The code is designed to run in Google Colab.

# Usage

Clone this repository or download the files.
Make sure the transcript file (harris-trump-transcript.txt) is available in the same directory.
Run the main script in Google Colab to generate text based on the transcript.
The generated text will be saved to generated_text.txt.

# Source of Transcript

The transcript used in this project is from the 9/11 2024 debate available on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgsC_aBquUE.
